A collection of my Leetcode solutions, meant so that anybody can see that I have done these Leetcodes; these solutions aren't for rigorous review, just to show that I did them (they aren't that impressive individually). I've done 56 easies, 42 mediums, and 2 hards. On average, my easy solutions beat 79.52% of other solutions; my medium solutions beat 70.99% of solutions; and my hards beat 20.58% (low sample size.) Interpretation of these numbers for should remember that this is generally a tool for CS undergrads, graduates, and professionals.
